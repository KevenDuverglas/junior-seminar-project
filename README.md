Connecting Blender to a large language model (LLM) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables users to control Blender's workflow entirely through voice commands. This setup allows for seamless, iterative creationâ€”where users can build, modify, and refine 3D scenes hands-free, simply by speaking their intentions.
